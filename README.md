Simple particle simulation with WebGL

Run base.html on a web browser to see the simulation.

The code is based on a WebGL framework called WebGLMiniFramework which can be used as a base for other Computer Graphics implementations. I had implemented it while teaching the grad course 3D Graphics for Video Games. 

Code related to particle simulation is in Particle.js and ParticleSystem.js
